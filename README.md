# Getting Started

The SDK is started by calling ```exp.start``` and specifying your credentials and configuration options. You may supply user, device, or consumer app credentials. You can also authenticate in pairing mode. When the promise returned by ```exp.start``` resolves, you are authenticated and can begin using the SDK. 

Users must specify their ```username```, ```password```, and ```organization```.

```javascript
exp.start({ username: 'joe@joemail.com', password: 'JoeRocks42', organization: 'joesorg' }).then(() => {});
```

Devices must specify their ```uuid``` and ```secret``` .
```javascript
exp.start({ uuid: '[uuid]', secret: '[secret]' })
```

Consumer apps must specify their ```uuid``` and ```apiKey```.

```javascript
exp.start({ uuid: '[uuid]', apiKey: '[api key]')
```

Advanced users can authenticate in pairing mode by setting ```allow_pairing``` to ```False```.

```python
exp.start({ allow_pairing=False })
```

Additional options:

Name | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
host | ```'https://api.goexp.io'``` | The api server to authenticate with.
enable_network | ```True``` | Whether to enable real time network communication. If set to ```False``` you will be unable to listen on the [EXP network](# Communicating on the EXP Network).

# Examples


## Creating a Device and Listening for Updates

Updates to API resources are sent out over a system channel with the event name "update".

```javascript
exp.createDevice({ 'name': 'my_sweet_device' }).then(device => {
  return device.save().then(() => {
    device.getChannel({ system: true }).listen('update', payload => {
      console.log('Device was updated!');
    });
  });
});
```


## Modifying a Resource in Place

```javascript
exp.getExperience('[uuid]').then(experience => {
  experience.document.name = 'new name';
  return experience.save()
});
```


## Using The EXP Network

The EXP network facilitates real time communication between entities connected to EXP. A user or device can broadcast a JSON serializable payload to users and devices in your organization, and listeners to those broadcasts can respond to the broadcasters.

### Channels

All messages on the EXP network are sent over a channel. Channels have a name, and two flags: ```system``` and ```consumer```.

```javascript
const channel = exp.getChannel('myChannel', { system: false, consumer: false });
```

Use ```system: true``` to get a system channel. You cannot send messages on a system channels but can listen for system notifications, such as updates to API resources.

Use ```consumer: true``` to get a consumer channel. Consumer devices can only listen or broadcast on consumer channels. When ```consumer: false``` you will not receive consumer device broadcasts and consumer devices will not be able to hear your broadcasts.

Both ```system``` and ```consumer``` default to ```false```. Consumer devices will be unable to broadcast or listen to messages on non-consumer channels.


### Broadcasting

Use the broadcast method of a channel object to send a named message containing an optional JSON serializable payload to other entities on the EXP network. You can optionally include a timeout to wait for responses to the broadcast. The broadcast will return a promise and resolve approximately after the given timeout (milliseconds) with a ```list``` of response payloads. Each response payload can any JSON serializable type.

```javascript
exp.getChannel('myChannel').broadcast('myEvent', 'hello', 5000).then(responses => {
  responses.forEach(response => console.log(response));
});
```

### Listening

To listen for broadcasts, call the listen method of a channel object.  Pass in the name of the event you wish to listen for and a callback to handle the broadcast. The callback will receive the broadcast payload. Listen returns a promise that resolves with a listener object when listening on the network has actually started. Calling cancel on the listener object stops the callback from being executed.


```javascript

exp.getChannel('myChannel').listen('myEvent', payload => {
  console.log('Event Received!');
  console.log(payload);
}).then(listener => {
  // Remove the listener after 5 seconds.
  setTimeout(() => listener.cancel(), 5000);
});

```


### Responding

To respond to a broadcast, call the second argument of the listener callback with your response.

```javascript

exp.getChannel('my_channel').listen('my_event', (payload, respond) => {
  if (payload === 'hello!') respond('hi there!');
});

```
